# Architectures

In a `monolithic architecture`, an entire application and all its features live within a single codebase.

An `n-tier architecture` splits an application into several layers. Each layer has a distinct responsibility. When a layer is hosted on its own dedicated server, it is called a tier. 

`Microservices architecture` refers to an application where features are spread across different services. Each service is responsible for a tightly defined component of business logic. Services should aim to have smaller, independent codebases. These aspects make microservices a more granular approach than architectures like n-tier.
