# Permissions

In Unix operating systems, the permissions for a file are represented using a line of 10 characters. The first character can either be - for a file or d for a directory. The other 9 characters are separated into three equal parts called triads.

```
-rwxrwxrwx
triads are for
owner, group, other
```
