# memory

Registers, cache, main (RAM), hard disk

- Virtualization gives the OS the ability to start a process, give it a certain amount of memory to work with, and have it seem to the process as though that is the only memory that exists.(Good for security)

# hard disk

The smallest chunk of this physical storage is called a sector.
