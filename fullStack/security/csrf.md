# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 

Trick user into submitting a web request on behalf of an attacker.

hide link such as

`http://bank.com/send?recipient=Stranger&amount=2000
`

or

`https://oursite.com/changepassword.php?new_password=[USER PASSWORD]
`

and get user (logged into `bank.com`, or `oursite.com`) to click it. 

CSRF attacks tend to target the web requests that are state-changing rather than requests that expect meaningful response data. 

## preventing

One of the simplest ways to prevent these attacks is to add a CSRF token. This token is a unique value that is added to each request. This value is dynamically generated by the server and used to verify all requests. This token is kept strictly with the form the user is currently on if they were making the legitimate request, so the attacker does not have access to it, and cannot get the user to complete the same request without the token.

This can still fail. If an application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, a hacker could use their XSS attack to extract this token!
