Do you have anything in common?

## Common questions

- What is your greatest strength?
- What is your greatest weakness?
- Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker?
- What makes you unique?
- Why should we hire you?

In the previous section, we talked about coming up with anecdotes to talk about all of those really tough interview questions. There is a method, called the STAR Method, that can assist in crafting an engaging anecdote.

STAR stands for:

S - Situation: the basic setup or premise of your anecdote. It sets the stage.

T - Task: your responsibility within the situation. What can you quantify here?

A - Action: the breakdown of what it took to get you from point A to point B.

R - Result: the outcome of the action.
